# Lattice Boltzmann method for solid mechanics

_LBM for solid mechanics_ is a novel lattice Boltzmann formulation to solve solid mechanics problems. This initial contribution considers linear elasticity in 2D in the quasi static limit.

See the [documentation](https://oboolakee.github.io/LBMforSolids-StaticLinearElasticity/) for details.
